# photobookspy

A rewrite of the server for my Photo Book library (currently Clojure/ClojureScript: http://books.mhurd.com). I plan to use this backend with an Elm GUI.

So far I've:

* rewritten the Amazon client code, effectively a Python verison of this: https://github.com/mhurd/books/blob/master/src/books/amazon/amazon_client.clj
